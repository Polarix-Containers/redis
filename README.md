### Features & usage
- Built on the [Docker Community's Alpine-based image](https://github.com/redis/docker-library-redis), to be used as a drop-in replacement.
- Unprivileged image: you should check your volumes' permissions (eg `/data`), default UID:GID is 991:1000.
- Removes unnecessary gosu SUID binary.

### Sample Docker Compose config

```
  redis:
    container_name: redis
    image: ghcr.io/polarix-containers/redis:7

    volumes:
      - ./redis:/data:Z
    user: "991:1000"
    read_only: true
    security_opt:
      - "no-new-privileges=true"
